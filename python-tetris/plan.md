# Plan for Rewriting JavaScript Tetris in Python

## Project Overview
This document outlines the plan for rewriting the JavaScript Tetris implementation in Python. The goal is to maintain feature parity while leveraging Python's strengths and appropriate libraries for graphics, game logic, and AI.

## Original JavaScript Implementation Analysis

### Key Components
1. **Game Logic (game.js)**
   - Core Tetris mechanics (piece movement, rotation, collision detection)
   - Game state management (play, pause, game over)
   - Scoring system and level progression
   - Canvas-based rendering

2. **AI Agent (heuristic_agent.js)**
   - Heuristic evaluation of board states
   - Move generation and selection
   - Lookahead planning (considering current and next piece)

3. **Utilities (utils.js)**
   - Automated gameplay for testing
   - Performance benchmarking

4. **Performance Monitoring (stats.js)**
   - FPS tracking
   - Memory usage monitoring

5. **UI (index.html)**
   - Game board display
   - Score and level information
   - Next piece preview
   - Controls and instructions

## Technology Selection for Python Implementation

### Graphics and UI
**Pygame** is the recommended library for this implementation because:
- It provides simple, direct access to display, sound, input devices, and events
- It has good performance for 2D games
- It's widely used and well-documented
- It offers similar drawing capabilities to HTML5 Canvas

Alternatives considered:
- **Tkinter**: Native to Python but less suitable for games with animation
- **PyQt/PySide**: Powerful but complex for a simple game like Tetris
- **Arcade**: Good for games but less mature than Pygame

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Core Game Logic (game.py)
- Implement the game board as a 2D array (similar to JavaScript version)
- Create game state management (play, pause, game over)
- Implement core mechanics:
  - Piece movement (left, right, down)
  - Rotation with collision detection
  - Line clearing and scoring
  - Level progression with increasing speed

### 2. Tetromino Pieces (tetromino.py)
- Define the seven standard Tetromino pieces
- Implement the bit manipulation for piece rotation and collision detection
- Create methods for rendering pieces

### 3. Rendering (renderer.py)
- Set up Pygame window and drawing surfaces
- Implement drawing functions for:
  - Game board
  - Current piece
  - Next piece preview
  - Score and level display
- Handle screen resizing

### 4. Input Handling (in main.py)
- Process keyboard events for:
  - Movement (arrow keys)
  - Rotation (up arrow)
  - Drop (space)
  - Pause/play (p)
  - Quit (escape)

### 5. AI Agent (heuristic_agent.py)
- Port the heuristic evaluation function
- Implement move generation and selection
- Create the lookahead planning system
- Add visualization options for AI decision-making

### 6. Utilities (utils.py)
- Implement helper functions
- Create automated gameplay for testing
- Add performance benchmarking tools

### 7. Performance Monitoring (performance.py)
- Create a simple FPS counter
- Add memory usage tracking if possible
- Implement a visual display similar to stats.js

- Add keyboard input handling

### Phase 3: Game Mechanics (Week 2)
- Implement line clearing and scoring
- Add level progression
- Create game state management

### Phase 4: AI Agent (Week 3)

- Implement automated gameplay
- Polish UI and add sound effects
- Optimize performance

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core game logic
- Integration tests for AI agent
- Performance benchmarks comparing to JavaScript version
- Manual testing for gameplay feel and UI

## Challenges and Considerations
1. **Performance**: Python is generally slower than JavaScript for certain operations. Optimization may be needed for the AI agent.
2. **Rendering**: Pygame's rendering model differs from HTML5 Canvas. Careful adaptation will be required.
3. **Bit Manipulation**: The JavaScript version uses bit manipulation for piece representation. Python's handling of bits is different and may require adaptation.
4. **Event Loop**: Managing the game loop in Pygame differs from requestAnimationFrame in JavaScript.

## Conclusion
This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to rewriting the JavaScript Tetris implementation in Python using Pygame. By following this structured approach, we can maintain feature parity while leveraging Python's strengths and the capabilities of the Pygame library.
